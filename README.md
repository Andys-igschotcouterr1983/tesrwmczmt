Just got out of the teater, mind's all over the place, like my thoughts are in a blender on high and someone forgot the lid. The Life List... what a trip. Hard to even start somewhere, but here goes— popcorn's stuck between my teeth— it was one of those 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 that was like opening a door to a room you've never noticed before in your own house. You know it’s there, familiar, but you just never walked in.

Kinda makes you feel like a piece of the jigsaw that's been under the sofa. The characters, oh man, they’re like those funky dreams you can almost remember when you wake up, snippets here and there. That random scene with the parrot? No idea how it ties in, but suddenly I want one in the living room.

>And the sound, such a racket, like my head was stuffed with bees while the seats made my back ache like I’d taken a nap in a shopping cart. Seriously, theaters should come with warning labels for those chair-shaped torture devices. Anyway, someone told me, or maybe i read somewhere — you should really 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   when it’s out.

The protagonist’s journey— I mean, his life was unraveling like my earphones in a pocket. All those lists... felt a bit like reading my grocery notes when I'm sleepwalking. And the way they shot the climax? Like riding a rollercoaster with a blindfold. Dizzying, ya know?

It was like... 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 someone balance on a thin piece of string over a kiddie pool filled with existential crises, yet he's 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ing jokes the whole way. Insane. Almost missed half of a scene fumbling with my phone, damn thing is quicker than the plot twists though.

Some guy behind me was wheezing like a broken accordion so much I was half expecting to turn around and find a stray cat concert. Almost made me forget where I was until THAT scene— unreal. Probably best just to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   yourself.

Anyway, lots of layers here or maybe I’m just in one of those moods. Felt like I was one step away from a mad hatter tea party with the Cheshire Cat on the horizon. Definitely one for the unpredictable rainy afternoon.
